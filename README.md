## **Architecture Overview**

The application is architected as a container-based system running on AWS. The backend API is deployed as a service on an ECS cluster, communicating with a managed RDS PostgreSQL database. The frontend is a single-page application built with React, hosted on S3, and delivered globally via CloudFront.  
The entire infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform, and the deployment process is fully automated with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
